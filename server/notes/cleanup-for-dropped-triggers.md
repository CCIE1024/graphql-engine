# Cleanup for dropped triggers

There was an issue (https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/5461)
fixed (via https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/pull/6137) related to
event triggers while replacing metadata in the catalog prior to metadata
separation. The metadata separation solves the issue naturally, since the
'hdb_catalog.event_triggers' table is no more in use and new/updated event
triggers are processed in building schema cache. But we need to drop the
database trigger and archive events for dropped event triggers. This is handled
explicitly in @'runReplaceMetadata' function.
